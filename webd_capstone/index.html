                    <h3>Montevideo, Uruguay</h3>
                    <p>Montevideo is the capital city of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, the political and economic center of the country, and the MERCOSUR administrative headquarters. <br> <br>
                        It was founded between 1724 and 1730 as a fortified town next to a port on the River Plate, in the big bay which holds Cerro de Montevideo (Montevideo’s Hill) . <br>
                        During this period, spanish families arrived from Buenos Aires and the Canary Islands to populate the new city. <br> <br>
                        Montevideo is a key destination in Latin America. All over the year,the city offers visitors a diverse cultural and recreational agenda, quality services, and beautiful landscapes, along with security and the typical hospitality of Uruguayans. <br>
                        Montevideo is also known as the seat for international congresses and events.</p>

                    <h3 class="culture_h">CULTURAL MONTEVIDEO</h3>
                    <h4 class="culture_h">Carnival</h4>
                    <p>From late January to March, Montevideo celebrates the longest carnival in the world. This popular celebration had its origin in different immigrant cultures, mostly Spanish and Africans. </p>
                    <h4 class="culture_h">Murgas</h4>
                    <p>Marching to the beat of its unique choral rhythm, popularly known as marcha camión, murgas criticize local events and ridicule politicians, sports and television figures. Murgas have supporters both in Uruguay and abroad. As well as being internationally renowned, the Uruguayan murga is one of the distinctive icons of the country.</p>
                    <h4 class="culture_h">Candombe </h4>
                    <p>By mid 18th century, the Port of Montevideo was the only access point for Africans slaves to enter the River Plate region. At the end of that century, 35% of Montevideo’s population was of African descent. Black slaves used to play the musical rhythms of their own countries in their spare time. The music they produced became known as tango, or tambo. It was not until 1830 that the term candombe appeared. Nowadays candombe is played in Montevideo streets during weekends and holidays.</p>
                    <h4 class="culture_h">Tango</h4>
                    <p>Tango music reflects the cultural relationship/companionship between Montevideo and Buenos Aires. This was expressed in a joint request submitted by both countries at the UNESCO to declare Tango as Intangible Heritage of Humanity. n the last decades of the 19th century, a massive flow of immigrants, mostly europeans, started to arrive in Uruguay and Argentina. Tango was born of this multicultural flow. Its musical background is African, Latin-American and European, merged in such a way that the resulting product is completely new.</p>
                    <h4 class="culture_h">Football</h4>
                    <p>In Montevideo, passion for football can be found at any corner of the city. From the Centenario Stadium, declared World Heritage Site by FIFA, and its museum, to the different matches of the professional league, Uruguayans really love football.</p>
                    <h4 class="culture_h">Racecourse of Maroñas</h4>
                    <p>Around 1850, the English community introduced race horses in Uruguay. Hipódromo de Maroñas is one of the main racetracks in the region, and features one of the best tracks in the world. Races are broadcast live, and bets are received from the United States and Mexico, among other countries.</p>
